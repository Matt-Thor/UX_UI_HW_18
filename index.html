            <h4>Non-Profit Case Study</h4>
            <p>Non profit organizations often function for the benefit of others, however due to their non profit focus they may not have the means to finance the most current web technology.
                <br></br> 
                We discovered an opportunity to provide a redesign concept for a local non profit.
                <br></br>
                We were able to create a modern design concept that prioritized access to information that our research uncovered as being most important.

            <h4>Department of Education Website Case Study</h4>
            <p>Government agency websites often lack strong branding and design principles.Additionally they are usually built on old technology and cannot easily be updated. 
                <br></br>
                By redesigning the Department of Education website with modern principalities and by creating a strong brand identity we were able to build a responsive design that users were able to navigate more intuitively and complete tasks in fewer steps.

            <h4>Goal Assistant Case Study</h4>
            <p>Many people struggle with making and keeping their long and short term goals. 
                    <br><br>
                The Goal Assistant App is a solution that allows users to drop a loosely imagined idea in their head onto their mobile device to help them track their goals and keeps them engaged in completing long and short term goals.
